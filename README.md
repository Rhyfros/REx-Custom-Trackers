# REx-Tracker

## Summary
Hi I made this for the REx: Reincarnated community to do basically anything they want with the trackers!

***YOU MIGHT NEED A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF PYTHON TO USE THIS!!!***

<ins>THIS IS A SIMPLE VERSION WHERE IT JUST PARSES YOUR MESSAGE AND SENDS IT TO A WEBHOOK!!!<ins>

THIS MAY TAKE TIME TO SETUP

## Instructions:

### Step 1. Download the project files.

- Code > Local > Download ZIP

- Unzip the file with your software of choice!

- - Mac should already have an unarchive software preinstalled.



### Step 2. Edit the project files.

#### Open it in your IDE of choice.

-  Examples being: IDLE, VSCode, or PyCharm.

#### Create a .env file in the ./**src**/ folder.
- Your .env file should be this format:
- - TOKEN='*TOKEN*'
- - WEBHOOK_URL = '*WEBHOOK_URL*'

(Your IDE might warn you if you created the .env file wrong.)


### Step 3. Run the Python code.
Make sure to open your terminal/console of choice

#### Go to the ./**src**/ folder 
- Depends on operating system (WILL ADD MORE AS MORE PEOPLE USE THIS)
- dir = directory/path

- - Mac: cd (dir)
- - Windows: cd (dir)

(It should show the directory on your current line in your terminal/console)

#### Install needed packages
- Depends on operating system (WILL ADD MORE AS MORE PEOPLE USE THIS)
- Pip explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)

- - python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

####  Run the file
- - It depends on PC and OS so try out these commands to figure out which works.

- - - python3 main.py
- - - python main.py
- - - py main.py

(If none of these works make sure you installed python to the correct path variable.)


## Done!

### You are now done with the code setup! What can you do with this?

#### Download the trackers!
- Can be done with an SQL database such as SQLite with the sqlite3 package or just dumping them into a json file.

## Adding to the project

(Currently I am allowing forks of this to be made!)

### Adding to the main branch
